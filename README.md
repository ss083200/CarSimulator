# Car Simulator

## Overview

The Car Simulator is a C++ application that allows users to control a car object using keyboard inputs. The simulator provides basic movement functions, including acceleration, deceleration, and turning. The car's behavior is visually represented using the SFML graphics library.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Simulator**: Run the application to open the car simulator window.
2. **Control the Car**:
   - Press 'W' to accelerate the car.
   - Press 'S' to decelerate the car.
   - Press 'A' to turn the car left.
   - Press 'D' to turn the car right.
   - Press 'X' to stop the car.
   - Press 'Z' to start the car.
   - Press 'Q' to quit the simulator.

3. **Observe the Car's Movement**: The car will respond to your inputs, and you can see its movement on the screen.
